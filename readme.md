<h1>To do list</h1>
<p>My first project, with really bad code arhitecture, style and design, but it was my first and here i used many techniques to practise and show some skill.</p>

<h3>Techniques such as:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Async request to weather API;</li>
  <li>working with DOM;</li>
  <li>state convertation to JSON and save to localstorage;</li>
  <li>drag and drop elements</li>
  <li>implantation side code (calendar) and adaptating to use it functionality</li>
  <li>sort operations</li>
  <li>...</li>
<ul>

<h3>Usage<h3>
<p>Simple open index file.</p>
<p>You can make your own to-do list, by adding tasks with Add button. It sort tasks by days. You can drag and drop tasks from one collumn to another. You can also edit tasks, remove them and mark that it's done. This list will be saved in your browser? and you can open it in any time.</p>
